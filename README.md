# Pipe Puzzle Solver

This project is a Python-based solver (search algorithm) for the Minesweeper game. The solver takes a grid with given numbers and mines and determines the correct configuration of mines on the board. It ensures that all numbered cells correctly reflect the number of adjacent mines while revealing all possible safe cells.

## Features

- Solves minesweeper of:

  +5x5 grid (easy)
 
  +7x7 grid (medium)

  +10x10 grid (hard)
  
  +20x20 grid (very hard)
  


## Installation

2. The program will ask you to enter the number of testcases you want to try
    ```sh
   Test case 1: 5x5 board
   Test case 2: 7x7 board
   Test case 3: 10x10 board
